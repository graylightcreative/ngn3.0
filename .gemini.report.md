The user asked me to update the `GEMINI.md` file with information about project documentation, progress tracking, and local MySQL setup.

I read the `GEMINI.md` file to find a suitable location for this new information. I decided to add a new section called "Local Development Setup" after the "Architecture" section.

The changes include:
- A reference to `/docs/bible` for documentation.
- A reference to `/storage/plan/progress.json` for tracking project progress.
- Details about local MySQL setup: using `root/root` credentials, the absence of migration files, and the plan to generate a new schema document after development.

I used the `replace` tool to insert this new section into `GEMINI.md`.

This completes the user's request.
