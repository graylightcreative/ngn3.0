## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Known Risks & Mitigation

**1. Blockchain network issues (probability: MEDIUM)**
- Mitigation: Test on testnet first, use RPC failover
- Fallback: Queue failed submissions for retry

**2. Gas prices spike (probability: HIGH)**
- Mitigation: Monitor prices, batch during low-gas windows
- Fallback: Layer 2 solutions ready

**3. Smart contract bugs (probability: LOW with audit)**
- Mitigation: Professional security audit (budgeted)
- Fallback: Deploy with pause mechanism

**4. Team blockers (probability: MEDIUM)**
- Mitigation: Reserve contractor time (budgeted)
- Escalation: Contact backup blockchain developer if needed
