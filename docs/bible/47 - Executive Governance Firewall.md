47 - EXECUTIVE GOVERNANCE FIREWALL

The firewall manages professional separation between the SaaS & Fintech Director and the Chief of Staff to ensure objective auditing.

Reporting Structure: Both roles report strictly to the Directorate Action Registry, not each other.

Deadlines: The Chief of Staff is the administrative voice of the Chairman to enforce technical milestones and SIR thresholds.

Audit Integrity: Financial critiques from the SaaS Directorate are treated as mandatory system signals.
