CHAPTER 31: The Directorate Action Registry & Protocol

Subject: Standardized Input Requests (SIRs), Deliverable Tracking, and The Closed-Loop System

1. THE GOVERNANCE LOGIC

As NGN 2.0 scales, the "Rant Protocol" must be anchored in a Paper Trail. To maintain institutional speed, board involvement is governed by the SIR (Standardized Input Request) model. This ensures that every hour of board time is spent on high-leverage decision-making rather than administrative catch-up.

2. THE SIR (STANDARDIZED INPUT REQUEST) FRAMEWORK

All requests from the Founder to the Board must be formatted with the following "Four Pillars":

The Objective: A one-sentence high-level goal (e.g., "Verify Escrow Compliance").

The Context: Why this matters for Series A or the NGN Score.

The Deliverable: What a "Finished" task looks like (e.g., A 1-page critique, a logic-gate approval, or a signed MOU).

The Threshold: The date/milestone by which this input is critical (e.g., "Required before Jan 26 Tax Activation").

3. THE DIRECTORATE STATUS BOARD (Tracking Logic)

All board tasks are tracked in a shared Institutional Registry using the following status states:

Status

Definition

Responsibility

OPEN

The SIR has been issued by the Chairman.

The Director/Advisor

IN REVIEW

The Director is analyzing the data/logic.

The Director/Advisor

RANT PHASE

The Director has provided feedback; the Founder is refining.

The Board

VERIFIED

The Director has "Signed Off" on the logic.

The Chairman (Archive)

CLOSED

The task is integrated into the NGN Bible.

System (Locked)

4. DIVISION OF LABOR: TRACKING THE "BRAIN TRUST"

A. The SaaS & Fintech Registry (Brandon Lamb)

Focus: Logic Gates, Stripe Connect splits, MRR scalability, and D&B credit maturation.

Output: Technical "Sign-offs" that prove the plumbing is bank-ready.

B. The Strategic Ecosystem Registry (Pepper Gomez)

Focus: Label facilitation, VC readiness, and "Heat Spike" validation.

Output: Handshake MOUs, Industry "First-Look" reports, and Network expansion milestones.

C. The Data Integrity Registry (Erik Baker)

Focus: SMR ingestion logs, SHA-256 validation, and "Bot-Kill" accuracy.

Output: Verified Data Receipts and SMR Historical Archive status.

5. THE QUARTERLY GOVERNANCE AUDIT

Every 90 days, the Chairman conducts a Governance Audit.

Metric: What percentage of SIRs moved from "Open" to "Verified"?

Purpose: To identify bottlenecks in the board workflow before they impact the $10,000 MRR Trigger.

6. THE "TASK MASTER" ROLE

Until the appointment of a Chief Compliance Officer, the Founder (Chairman) acts as the Task Master, ensuring that the Registry is updated and that no SIR remains "Open" for more than 14 days without a board update.

7. CLI/DEVELOPMENT MANDATE: MOBILE GOVERNANCE INTERFACE

To ensure maximum responsiveness from the Board, the CLI must facilitate an automated mobile notification and management layer.

Push Notifications: Board members must receive real-time mobile alerts when a new SIR is issued or when a "Rant Phase" requires their input.

Mobile Management: The system must allow Board Directors to update task status (e.g., moving an item to "VERIFIED" or "RANT PHASE") directly from their mobile devices via a secured PWA hook or CLI-driven message system.

Sign-off Protocol: Develop a "one-tap" verification process for Technical Sign-offs to ensure that Brandon, Pepper, and Erik can provide executive oversight without technical friction.
