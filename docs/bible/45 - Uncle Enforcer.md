45 - THE UNCLE / ENFORCER DYNAMIC

Subject: Professional Firewalls, Fiduciary Neutrality, and Conflict Resolution.
Classification: BOARD LEVEL ONLY

1. THE ARCHITECT’S POSITION

As NGN 2.0 matures, the distinction between family roles (Uncle/Niece) and corporate roles (Director/Chief of Staff) must be absolute. This protects the professional integrity of Brandon Lamb (SaaS Director) and Kielah Lamb (Chief of Staff).

2. THE GOVERNANCE FIREWALL

The relationship between the Director (Brandon) and the Chief of Staff (Kielah) is governed strictly by the SIR Registry (Ch. 15).

The Rule of Neutrality: Within the Forge, Brandon does not report to Kielah, and Kielah does not "boss" Brandon. They both report to the Logic of the Registry.

The SIR Hook: When Kielah issues a "Nudge" for an overdue task, she is acting as the Automated Voice of the Chairman.

The Professional Switch: Professional disputes are "Cleared" at the end of the business day. The "No-BS Boss" at 4:59 PM becomes the "Niece" at 5:01 PM.

3. CONFLICT MEDIATION

In the event of a professional disagreement:

Stage 1: The Registry Check. Does the dispute involve a documented SIR or Operational Rule? If yes, the Registry wins.

Stage 2: The Chairman’s Mediation. The Chairman (Jon Brock Lamb) makes the final executive call based on the $54M Exit probability.

Bernard's Audit: If Kielah can keep a skeptic like Brandon on track, she can handle any VC on the planet. This is the elite level of her training.
