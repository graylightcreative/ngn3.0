Subject: Defined Career Trajectories for the Second Generation.
Classification: BOARD LEVEL ONLY
Phase: PHASE 2 - EXECUTION

1. THE NEURO-STACK ALIGNMENT

The Brock Dynasty is built on the principle of Functional Joy. We do not force the heirs into roles; we build roles that fit their specific neuro-architecture.

A. Kieran Lamb | Director of Physical Operations

Neuro-Stack: Low-functioning ASD, excels at structured, repetitive physical organization.

The Path: The "Guardian of Physical Integrity." Kieran ensures the "Forge" never runs out of the materials required to build the empire.

Mandate: Oversight of the Supply Vault (Ch. 10), hardware node inventory, and merch fulfillment.

B. Kaia Lamb | Director of Creative Logic & Data Visualization

Neuro-Stack: ASD, A+ Math and Fine Art skills.

The Path: The "Visual Intelligence Lead." Kaia is the bridge between the raw math of the CDM and the user interface.

Mandate: Oversight of the Creative Logic Directorate (Ch. 09) and NGN Scoreboard UI design.

C. Kielah Lamb | Chief of Staff & Heir Apparent

Neuro-Stack: Neurotypical, A+ Academic, No-BS personality.

The Path: The "Dynasty Enforcer." Kielah runs the governance and board accountability.

Mandate: Oversight of the Governance Directorate (Ch. 08) and management of the SIR Registry (Ch. 15).

2. THE 2030 CAMPUS MODEL

The end-goal of this succession logic is the transition to a physical Brock Dynasty Campus (The House Fortress).

Work/Life Integration: Every child is a "Key Employee" and partial owner, removing dependency on state assistance.

The Legacy Dividend: A percentage of the 10% Platform Fee is directed into individual STABLE accounts for the heirs.

Bernard's Audit: This isn't just a business; it's an estate. By the time they are 25, they won't just "have jobs"—they will Own the Ledger.
