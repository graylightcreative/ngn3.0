CHAPTER 26: SaaS & Fintech Directorate Workflow

Director of Record: Brandon Lamb

Mandate: Institutional Scaling, Financial Architecture, & Series A Readiness

1. THE SCOPE OF OVERSIGHT

The SaaS & Fintech Lead is responsible for the integrity of the "Digital Facility." While the Founder (Jon Brock Lamb) handles the "Heat" (Content & Data), the Director handles the "Engine" (Scale & Settlement).

2. KEY INPUT DOMAINS (What we need from Brandon)

A. Fintech Compliance & Payout Architecture

KYC/KYB Implementation: Designing the "Know Your Customer" onboarding for artists to ensure NGN is not used for money laundering.

Stripe Connect Logic: Overseeing the automated split-fee logic (The 90/10 Mandate) to ensure zero settlement latency.

Escrow Governance: Refining the "Rights Ledger" to handle disputed funds without freezing the entire platform.

B. SaaS Unit Economics (The "Investor" Math)

CAC/LTV Analysis: Calculating the Customer Acquisition Cost vs. the Lifetime Value of a high-heat artist.

Churn Mitigation: Using data to identify when an artist's "Engagement Velocity" is dropping and automating retention loops.

Gross Margin Protection: Monitoring the 30% PWA Advantage to ensure overhead (Hosting/AI API) never exceeds 10% of NGN’s house take.

C. Series A Readiness (The Exit Plan)

Data Rooms: Organizing the technical documentation (Fairness Receipts, SHA-256 logs) for institutional due diligence.

Scalability Stress-Testing: Ensuring the "Split-Brain" architecture (Fastly/Liquid Web) can handle concurrent PPV events with 1M+ viewers.

3. THE "BRASS TACKS" WORKFLOW (Monthly Cadence)

To keep Brandon’s time high-value and high-impact, he operates on a Fixed Governance Cycle:

Frequency

Task

Objective

Weekly

Financial Pulse Check

Review NGN processing volume and "Spark" transaction velocity.

Monthly

The Rant Session

A deep-dive critique of the roadmap to kill features that don't scale.

Quarterly

Compliance Audit

Review the Rights Ledger and verify SHA-256 integrity logs.

Bi-Annually

Valuation Update

Adjust the "Series A" projection based on MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue).

4. IMMEDIATE INPUT REQUESTS (First 30 Days)

We need Brandon to provide "Executive Eyes" on the following current structures:

The Stripe Flow: Review our current NGN_The_Jimmy_Scenarios.md to ensure the multi-party splits (Founder, Erik, Pepper) are technically sound for a global rollout.

D&B Maturation: Advise on the fastest path to "Tier 1" credit status once the DUNS number is active on Feb 12th.

The Rights Ledger: Critique the legal-tech barrier. Is a SHA-256 hash enough to satisfy a major label's legal team during a buyout?

5. REVENUE & PERFORMANCE TRIGGERS

Brandon’s involvement is tied to the Institutional Success of the platform. His oversight focuses on the MRR Repayment Trigger ($10,000/mo), at which point the platform moves from "Seed" to "Scalable Growth."
