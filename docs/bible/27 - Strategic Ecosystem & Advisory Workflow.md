CHAPTER 27: Strategic Ecosystem & Advisory Workflow

Director of Record: Pepper Gomez (Wake Up! Music Group)

Mandate: Ecosystem Architecture, Industry Facilitation, & Market Intelligence

1. THE SCOPE OF OVERSIGHT

The Founding Board Advisor is responsible for the "Heat" and "Credibility" of the platform. While the SaaS Lead (Brandon Lamb) handles the "Engine," the Advisor ensures the engine is processing the right assets and maintaining the trust of legacy label structures and elite talent.

2. KEY INPUT DOMAINS (What we need from Pepper)

A. Ecosystem Architecture & Facilitation

The "Handshake" Pipeline: Identifying and facilitating contact with high-value stakeholders (e.g., Erik Baker, Radio Networks, and Tier-1 Musicians).

Institutional Bridge: Acting as the primary liaison between NGN 2.0 and the global label ecosystem to ensure the Rights Ledger meets industry standards.

Network Effect Oversight: Strategic guidance on which artist "clusters" or genres provide the highest engagement velocity for Phase 2 scaling.

B. Market Intelligence & Label Synergy

The "First-Look" Window: Utilizing NGN data to identify "Breakout Assets" for potential signing to Wake Up! Music Group before data goes public.

Competitive Analysis: Providing "Street-level" feedback on how legacy labels are reacting to NGN’s 90/10 model to help the platform stay ahead of the "Innovator's Dilemma."

A&R Logic: Refining the Meritocratic Ranking Algorithm to ensure it aligns with what professional A&Rs actually look for in new signings.

C. The "Rant" Protocol (Operational Governance)

Creative Friction: Participating in "The Rant"—the healthy, intensive critique of the NGN development roadmap.

Quality Control: Flagging features that may alienate high-level talent or disrupt the integrity of the artist-to-fan relationship.

3. THE "MUSE" WORKFLOW (Strategic Cadence)

To respect the Advisor’s schedule as a Label Group Owner, the workflow is built on High-Impact Interventions:

Frequency

Task

Objective

Ad-Hoc

The Rant Session

Rapid-fire feedback on new architecture or "Handshake" opportunities.

Monthly

Ecosystem Review

Audit of new artist sign-ups and "Heat Spike" validation via the NGN Score.

Quarterly

Strategic Roadmapping

Planning the next 90 days of "Bouncer Mode" rollouts and venue partnerships.

Annual

Board Governance

Reviewing the platform's "Exit-Readiness" for potential Series A or acquisition.

4. IMMEDIATE INPUT REQUESTS (First 30 Days)

We need the Advisor’s "Industry Eye" on the following:

VC Facilitation: Reviewing the Institutional SaaS-Enabled Fintech Proposal for final presentation to venture capital contacts.

Erik Baker Finalization: Overseeing the formal transfer of the 2022-2026 SMR Historical Archive into the NGN CDM.

The 95/5 Model: Reviewing the onboarding process for Wake Up! Music Group artists to ensure the "Elite Partner Status" is functioning seamlessly.

5. REVENUE & OVERRIDE ALIGNMENT

The Advisor’s involvement is tied to the Ecosystem Success of the platform through the following triggers:

Strategic Override: 5% of NGN’s platform fee is automatically routed to the Advisor on all transactions facilitated through her direct introductions.

The Label Advantage: All artists signed to Wake Up! Music Group operate on a permanent 95/5 split (5% platform fee), giving the Advisor’s label a unique margin advantage in the marketplace.
