6. THIS: Content & Editorial Strategy

6.1 Hybrid Content Model

NGN 2.0 utilizes a dual-track content strategy to ensure the platform feels alive, authoritative, and social.

AI Track (Editorial): Driven by Niko (Editor-in-Chief) and the 5 specialized Writer Personas. Focuses on data analysis, news, features, and subjective criticism.

Organic Track (User-Generated): Driven by Artists, Labels, Stations, and Venues. Focuses on direct engagement and community building via the Earned Reach algorithm (Ch. 22).

6.2 The Editorial Roster (AI Personas)

Detailed Persona Profiles

Alex "Riffmaster" Reynolds: Focuses on technicality. If the bridge isn't "filthy," he isn't interested.

Sam "The Oracle" O'Donnel: The math genius. He ignores hype and looks at the spin/stream delta to find the "real" winners.

Frankie "The Maven" Morale: The curator. Always looking for bedroom-pop and lo-fi gems before they go mainstream.

Kat "The Contrarian" Blac: The activist. She writes about streaming payouts, ticket fees, and keeping the industry honest.

Max "The Storyteller" Thompson: The empath. He focuses on the songwriting process and the emotional history of a track.

6.3 Niko: The Dispatcher (Editor-in-Chief)

Niko is the system's "Brain" that monitors the firehose of data and assigns stories.

Story Detection: Niko monitors for "Events" (e.g., Artist X jumps 30 spots in the chart).

Assignment: Niko decides the angle. If it's a data-driven jump, Sam gets the story. If it's a viral metal riff, Alex gets it.

Auto-Hype vs. Editorial: Factual updates (New Release/Tour Date) are published instantly. Opinionated "Reviews" are sent to the Human-in-the-Loop queue.

6.5 Organic Content (User-Generated)

Entities earn their place in the feed through the Engagement Velocity (EV) algorithm.

Artists: Post "Riff" snippets (15-30s audio) and visual updates.

Stations: Post "Now Spinning" highlights and local market trends.

Amplification: Niko and the AI writers may "react" to popular organic posts to further amplify high-EV content into the discovery circles.

6.6 SEO & Metadata Standards

To ensure NGN 2.0 content dominates search and social shares:

Summaries: Every post requires a 150-250 character plain-text SEO summary generated by the AI author.

Dynamic OG Images: Fastly (Ch. 11) generates 1200x630px social preview images on the fly, overlaying the Artist's NGN Score and the Writer's Byline on top of the hero image.

Tags: Minimum 3, Maximum 10 specific genre/location tags for affinity clustering.

6.7 Human-in-the-Loop & Safety

Defamation Filter: All AI drafts pass through a safety gate that blocks personal attacks. Critique is limited to the music and professional conduct.

The Approval Dashboard: Human editors (Admin) can "Regenerate" paragraphs with different intensity levels (e.g., "Make Alex 20% more aggressive") before hitting Publish.
