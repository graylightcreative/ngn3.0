CHAPTER 32: Growth Architecture & The 10,000 Artist Roadmap

Subject: Automated Customer Acquisition (ACA), The Ingestion Trap, and Label Multipliers

1. THE EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY: THE YELP MODEL

NGN 2.0 does not suffer from the "Cold Start" problem because we do not wait for artists to find us. We utilize The Ingestion Trap:

The Index: Using Erik Baker’s SMR Historical Archive (Ch. 28), we automatically generate "Claimable Profiles" for every artist currently appearing on terrestrial radio logs.

The Ghost Profile: Before an artist even knows NGN 2.0 exists, they already have a ranking, a NGN Score, and—most importantly—Pending Spark Tips generated by their existing fan base.

2. THE THREE PHASES OF EXECUTION

PHASE 1: The Data Ingestion (0 to 10,000 Artists)

Mechanic: We ingest 5 years of SMR logs (Erik).

Result: We instantly populate the platform with the top 10,000 active artists in the "High-Heat" and "Secondary" markets.

The Hook: These aren't "users" yet—they are "Assets under Management." They are already earning a NGN Score.

PHASE 2: The "Pending Wealth" Trigger (The Conversion)

Mechanic: Niko (The AI Concierge) monitors the NGN Score spikes. When an un-claimed artist hits a "Heat Threshold," Niko triggers an automated outreach:

"Hey [Artist], you are trending #4 on the NGN Indie Charts this week. You have $412.00 in pending tips waiting in the Rights Ledger. Claim your profile to unlock your payout."

The Math: The conversion rate for "Claim your money" is $~10x$ higher than "Sign up for a new platform."

PHASE 3: The Label Multipliers (The Scale)

Mechanic: Instead of onboarding 1-by-1, we use Pepper Gomez’s Strategic Ecosystem (Ch. 27).

The Bulk Handshake: By onboarding a single "Elite Partner" label (like Wake Up! Music Group), we ingest their entire roster (100+ artists) in a single API call.

The Ratio: 1 Label Handshake = 100 Verified Artists. To get to 10k artists, we only need 100 Label Handshakes.

3. THE "BOUNCER MODE" VIRAL LOOP

Physical venues act as "Customer Acquisition Nodes":

The Venue: A venue signs up for Bouncer Mode (Ch. 8) to manage their door.

The Artist: The 3 local bands playing that night are required to "Check In" via the NGN app to get their set-times and payouts.

The Fans: The 200 fans at the door scan a QR code to enter, which automatically "follows" the artist on NGN 2.0.

4. UNIT ECONOMICS OF GROWTH

Brandon’s concern about "How" is solved by our Negative CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):

Legacy Model: Pay $5.00 in ads to get 1 user.

NGN Model: Ingest data we already own (SMR) $\rightarrow$ Create value for the artist $\rightarrow$ Artist brings their fans to "unlock" the value.

Outcome: The artists do the marketing for us because NGN is the "Bank" where their money is being held.

5. THE EXECUTION ROADMAP (MILESTONES)

MONTH 1: Ingest SMR Archives (10,000 "Ghost Profiles" live).

MONTH 2: Trigger Niko's "Claim Your Payout" campaign for the top 500 trending artists.

MONTH 3: Execute first 10 Label Handshakes (1,000 Verified Artists).

MONTH 6: 10,000 Verified Artists active via the Viral Loop.
