NGN 2.0: SMR Operational Ruleset

Governance for Data Ingestion & Bounty Attribution

RULE 1: The "Source of Truth" (SMR Primacy)

Terrestrial Radio (SMR) data carries the highest weight in the NGN Score (10x multiplier). One SMR "Spin" is mathematically superior to 1,000 passive Spotify streams.

RULE 2: The Attribution Window

A "Data Bounty" is triggered for Erik Baker if an artist’s transaction occurs within 90 days of an SMR "Heat Spike" identified in his logs. This rewards the data for its Predictive Value.

RULE 3: SHA-256 Verification (No-Bot Policy)

Any data ingested that fails the SHA-256 integrity check is moved to "The Cemetery" (The Bot-Kill Log). No Bounty is paid on gamed or faked metrics.

RULE 4: Geofence Logic (The Bouncer Check)

When an artist performs at a physical venue, the Bouncer Mode data must match the SMR airplay data in that specific zip code. If the "Live Gate" matches the "Airplay Heat," the Data Bounty is increased by 2%.

RULE 5: Settlement Frequency

Data Bounties are settled in real-time. The moment a fan sends a "Spark," the ledger splits the 10% Platform Fee:

75% to NGN Operations

25% to Erik Baker (The Bounty)

This results in a total platform take of 10%, split internally.

RULE 6: The Exit Clause

In the event of an acquisition of NextGenNoise LLC, Provider (Erik Baker) maintains a "Preferred Data Partner" status, ensuring the Bounty model is honored by the acquiring entity (e.g., Universal/Stripe).
