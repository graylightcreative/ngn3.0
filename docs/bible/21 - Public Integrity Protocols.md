21. Public Integrity & Anti-Cheat Protocols

21.1 The "Proof of Noise" Philosophy

To become the industry standard, NGN must be more than accurate; it must be auditable. We solve the "Payola Suspicion" by making our anti-cheat results as public as the charts themselves.

21.2 Cryptographic Chart Signing (The Receipt)

To prove that the platform admin (or a hacker) didn't manually "tweak" the numbers after the calculation:

The Week-Hash: Every Monday at 06:00 UTC, the system generates a SHA-256 hash of the entire raw dataset used for that week's calculation.

Public Ledger: This hash is published alongside the chart.

Auditability: Any auditor with access to the raw data (see 21.5) can re-run the hash to verify that the data hasn't been altered post-publication.

21.3 The "Bot-Kill" Transparency Report

Transparency isn't just showing the good data; it's showing the bad data we caught.

The Cemetery: A public-facing dashboard showing the volume of "Neutralized Noise" for the week.

Example: "This week, NGN detected and discarded 45,200 bot-driven shares and 12,000 fraudulent spins."

Methodology Disclosure: While we keep the exact "Tipping Points" secret to prevent reverse-engineering, we publicly list the categories of discarded data (e.g., "Non-Residential IP Spikes," "Repetitive Interaction Loops").

21.4 The "Pay-to-Play" Firewall

We must strictly decouple Financial Support from Ranking Influence.

Spark Visibility: Any artist whose rank is significantly influenced by "Boosts" or "Tips" is not "boosted" in the chart, but their EQS (Engagement Quality Score) is high.

The Sponsored Tag: If an artist is appearing in the "Suggested" feed due to a paid campaign (Ch. 18.5), they are explicitly labeled. They cannot buy their way into the Top 10 SMR or NGN Global charts.

21.5 The Community Oversight Committee (COC)

To prove we aren't biased, we empower the community.

Role: A rotating group of 5-7 high-trust users (1 Label, 1 Artist, 1 Station Owner, 2 Fans, 1 Admin).

Access: The COC is granted read-only access to anonymized raw logs for the "Top 10" entries of the week.

The "Sniff Test": They can flag any entry for a "Deep Audit" if they suspect the data doesn't match real-world momentum.

21.6 SMR Reconciliation (Peer Review)

Since SMR data is manually ingested (Ch. 5), it is the most vulnerable to bias claims.

Peer-Verification: When Station A submits a spin log, the system cross-references it with Station B in the same market.

The "Outlier" Flag: If an artist is only "exploding" on one specific station with no movement elsewhere, Sam (The Oracle) flags it as an "Outlier" in the public Fairness Summary.

21.7 Verified Human Weighting

The ultimate anti-cheat is a verified identity.

Weighting Delta: Engagement from a user with a verified Stripe Identity or a 2-year-old Social OAuth history carries 10x the weight of a new or unverified account.

Bot-Cost: This makes it economically impossible to "buy" a chart position, as the cost of creating 1,000 verified human accounts far exceeds the potential payout.
