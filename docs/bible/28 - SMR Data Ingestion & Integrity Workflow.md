CHAPTER 28: SMR Data Ingestion & Integrity Workflow

Director of Record: Erik Baker (SMR Entity)

Mandate: Data Integrity, SMR Indexing, & Institutional Truth

1. THE SCOPE OF OVERSIGHT

The Data Rights Advisor is responsible for the "Source of Truth." While the SaaS Lead (Brandon Lamb) handles the "Engine," the Advisor ensures that the data fueling the NGN Score is verified, un-hackable, and grounded in the reality of Terrestrial Radio (SMR).

2. KEY INPUT DOMAINS (What we need from Erik)

A. SMR Ingestion & Historical Archiving

The 2022-2026 Master Archive: Facilitating the mass-transfer of historical radio logs into the NGN Canonical Data Model (CDM) for back-testing and predictive heat-mapping.

Real-Time Log Ingestion: Providing weekly or daily SMR logs to anchor the "Live" NGN Score in terrestrial airplay data.

Data Cleansing Oversight: Collaborating with the tech team to refine the CDM matching logic, ensuring artist names and station IDs are matched with 100% accuracy.

B. Integrity & Verification (SHA-256)

Fairness Receipt Validation: Overseeing the digital "fingerprinting" process. Every log Erik provides is hashed with a SHA-256 signature, proving he is the sole source of the data.

Bot-Farm Neutralization: Using SMR airplay as the "Control Group" to identify and neutralize fake digital streaming heat (The Cemetery).

Editorial Authority: Final approval on which artists and stations receive the "SMR Verified" badge, maintaining the gatekeeper status of terrestrial radio.

C. The "Rant" Protocol (Operational Governance)

Data Ethics: Participating in "The Rant" to ensure that ranking algorithms never prioritize "pay-to-play" or gamed metrics over real-world airplay heat.

Feedback Loops: Providing "Street-level" feedback on how radio programmers and station owners are reacting to the NGN 2.0 interface.

3. THE "TRUTH" WORKFLOW (Data Cadence)

To ensure the NGN Score is the industry's most accurate index, Erik operates on a Verification Cycle:

Frequency

Task

Objective

Weekly

Log Synchronization

Ingesting the latest SMR cycles into the NGN 2.0 Engine.

Monthly

Integrity Audit

Reviewing "Bot-Kill" logs to ensure radio data is effectively neutralizing fake streams.

Quarterly

Predictive Modeling

Analyzing historical 2022-2026 data to refine the NGN Score's predictive power.

Annual

Institutional Reporting

Generating the "Year in Heat" report for labels and VCs.

4. IMMEDIATE INPUT REQUESTS (First 30 Days)

We need the Advisor’s "Expert Eye" on the following:

2022 Archive Transfer: Initiating the ingestion of the historical record to populate the CDM with "Legacy Heat."

Fairness Receipt Workflow: Reviewing the SHA-256 hashing process to ensure it provides sufficient "Audit Proof" for institutional investors.

Station Onboarding: Identifying the first 10 "Power Stations" to receive the NGN 2.0 Station Dashboard for automated SMR reporting.

5. REVENUE & BOUNTY ALIGNMENT

The Advisor’s involvement is tied to the Predictive Accuracy of the platform through the following triggers:

The Data Bounty: 5% of NGN’s platform fee is automatically routed to the Advisor for all transactions (Sparks/Merch/Tickets) occurring within the "Heat Window" identified by his logs.

Verified Asset Fee: Potential for a per-log ingestion fee as the platform scales to handle thousands of international radio nodes.

Equity Participation: Future stake in the "Data Moat" as SMR becomes the standard currency for institutional artist valuation.
