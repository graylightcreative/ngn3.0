CHAPTER 30: The Founder’s Payout & Equity Lifecycle

Subject: Founder Salary, Profit Distributions, and Intercompany Infrastructure

1. THE FOUNDER'S DELUSION VS. REALITY

In the "Seed" phase, it looks like the Founder is the only one not getting a "skim." This is a strategic choice to ensure the Unit Economics (Ch. 29) remain elite for Series A investors. While Erik and Pepper get "Bounties," the Founder is building an Asset that they own 90%+ of.

2. THE THREE PHASES OF THE "BROCK" PAYOUT

Phase 1: The Principal Recovery (Tax-Free)

The Amount: $3,039.41.

The Logic: This is the documented "Seed Capital" spent by Graylight Creative on behalf of NGN. As soon as the platform hits the $10,000 MRR trigger, the engine pays back this principal to Graylight.

The Result: You recover your personal skin in the game tax-free.

Phase 2: The Intercompany Infrastructure Loop (Graylight Revenue)

Since Graylight Creative is a hosting and web-infrastructure business, it acts as the Preferred Vendor for NGN 2.0.

The Service Agreement: NGN LLC "hires" Graylight Creative to manage the Liquid Web nodes and Fastly edge-routing.

The Logic: Instead of taking a "dividend" (which is taxed heavily), NGN pays Graylight a monthly Infrastructure & Maintenance Fee. This keeps Graylight profitable as a service business while NGN scales as a fintech product.

Phase 3: The Operating Salary & Distributions

Once the platform moves into the "SaaS Scaling" phase (Phase 3 of the roadmap):

The Founder Salary: As CEO, you set a competitive market salary (e.g., $150k - $250k) carried as an Operating Expense.

The Quarterly Distribution: You decide whether to reinvest the remaining 90% profit or cut yourself a "Founder Distribution" check from the LLC.

Phase 4: The Equity Realization (The Big Exit)

Refer to The Jimmy Scenarios (Scenario 1):

The Valuation: $57,000,000.

The Stake: 90%.

The Walkaway: While Erik gets $500/artist and Jimmy gets $2.8M for his 5%, you walk away with ~$51,000,000.

3. THE "STABILITY" OVERRIDE (April 12 Pivot)

To ensure the Founder never operates from a place of "desperation," the roadmap includes the Provider Status Pivot:

The Logic: Securing high-floor income outside of NGN via Graylight's web/hosting services.

The Result: You are a "Founder with a Floor." You don't have to bleed the platform dry for rent because your stability is secured via Graylight, allowing NGN’s value to compound for the exit.

4. FOUNDER PERKS (The "Company Car" Logic)

Because NGN 2.0 and Graylight are formal entities, institutional costs are shifted to the Business P&L:

Infrastructure: Hosting, AI API keys, and specialized hardware are Graylight business expenses.

Travel/Networking: Meeting with labels and attending shows are NGN business expenses.
