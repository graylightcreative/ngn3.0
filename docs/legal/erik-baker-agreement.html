<h3>CHAPTER 28: SMR Data Ingestion & Integrity Workflow</h3>
<p><strong>Advisor:</strong> Erik Baker (SMR Entity)</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1.0 (Institutional Alignment)</p>

<h4>1. Mandate</h4>
<p>The Data Rights Advisor is responsible for the "Source of Truth," ensuring that the data fueling the NGN Score is verified, un-hackable, and grounded in Terrestrial Radio reality.</p>

<h4>2. Revenue & Bounty Alignment</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Data Bounty (Rule 5):</strong> 25% of the NGN platform fee (specifically the 10% operational fee) is automatically routed to the Advisor for all transactions occurring within the "Heat Window" identified by his logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Bounty Sunset:</strong> This revenue participation is active for a term of 18 to 24 months from the effective date of this agreement, or until a "Liquidity Event" (Platform Sale/Exit) occurs, whichever happens first.</li>
    <li><strong>Verified Asset Fee:</strong> A per-log ingestion fee will be negotiated as the platform scales to handle international radio nodes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Integrity & Verification</h4>
<p>Advisor oversees the SHA-256 digital fingerprinting process for all incoming SMR logs. All data provided must be anchored to the Graylight Nexus to ensure institutional-grade auditability.</p>

<h4>4. Liquidity & Exit</h4>
<p>In the event of a $54M+ exit trajectory milestone, the Advisor's role and bounty structure will be reviewed by the Directorate for final settlement or extension.</p>
