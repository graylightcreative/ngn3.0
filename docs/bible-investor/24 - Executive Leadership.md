# Chapter 24: Executive Leadership Framework

## Executive Summary

NGN's leadership model emphasizes **professional roles over family titles**, building an institutional team that can scale to 50+ people by 2027. Organizational structure: **CEO (founder-led)**, **COO** (operations/scaling), **CTO** (technology/architecture), **Head of Artist Growth** (acquisition/partnerships), **Head of Finance** (fundraising/unit economics). Compensation is market-competitive (essential for hiring top talent). By 2027, org has 40+ employees structured in four departments: Engineering (12 people), Operations (8 people), Partnerships/Sales (6 people), Finance/Legal (4 people). Leadership pipeline: No single person is critical (CEO can be replaced; business survives). This institutional maturity attracts Series A capital and enables acquisition of top talent.

## 4. Hiring Philosophy & Culture

### 4.1 Hiring Process

**Step 1: Define role** (What problem are we hiring for?)
- Clear job description
- Success metrics
- Required skills

**Step 2: Source candidates**
- Network recruiting (ask current employees)
- LinkedIn (if network insufficient)
- Recruiters (if urgent, high-level role)

**Step 3: Phone screen** (culture fit + basic qualifications)
- Phone call with hiring manager
- 30 minutes
- Screen out obviously bad fits

**Step 4: In-depth interview** (skills assessment)
- 2-3 rounds with different people
- Technical assessment (for engineering)
- Case study (for partnerships, growth)
- Culture fit (with team)

**Step 5: Reference checks** (confirmation)
- Call previous managers
- Verify employment
- Confirm accomplishments

**Step 6: Offer** (clear expectations)
- Written offer letter
- Clear compensation (base, equity, bonus)
- Start date negotiation

**Time to hire**: 4-6 weeks (competitive for startup)

### 4.2 Compensation Philosophy

**Market-competitive pay**:
- Know salary ranges (Glassdoor, Level.fyi)
- Pay at market 60th percentile (good talent, not breaking bank)
- Equity as upside (founder gets most, employees get meaningful stakes)

**Example: Senior Engineer**:
- Base salary: $180-200K (market rate for Bay Area)
- Equity: 0.25-0.5% (typical startup allocation)
- Bonus: 0-15% (performance-based)
- Benefits: Health insurance, 401k, parental leave

**Why this works**:
- Can attract strong people (competitive pay)
- Align incentives (equity makes them care about outcome)
- Sustainable (pay is real, not overstretched)

### 4.3 Culture & Values

**NGN culture pillars**:

**1. Transparency**
- Share financials with team
- Explain decisions (why we hired, why we're pivoting)
- Admit mistakes ("We made wrong bet on feature X")

**2. Artist-first**
- Everything we build is for artists
- Understand artist pain points (rotate team onto artist calls)
- Question decisions: "Does this help artists?"

**3. Meritocracy**
- Promote based on performance, not tenure
- Pay fairly (no gender/race pay gaps)
- Admit mistakes in hiring (fire fast if wrong hire)

**4. Urgency**
- Move fast (market window closes 2027-2028)
- Ship weekly (not quarterly)
- Bias toward action (try and learn, don't over-analyze)

**5. Care**
- Take care of team (health insurance, mental health)
- Flexible work (remote ok if productivity high)
- Work-life balance (no heroic 80-hour weeks)

---

## 5. Scaling the Organization

### 5.1 Growth Stages

**2024-2025 (12 people)**:
- Founder as CEO, CTO, Head of Growth
- Ad-hoc processes
- Everyone wears multiple hats
- Cash-conscious (pre-Series A)

**2025-2026 (25 people)**:
- Hire COO (operations)
- Hire Head of Artist Growth (partnerships)
- Early process documentation
- Fundraising distraction (Series A)

**2026-2027 (40+ people)**:
- All core leadership hired
- Process maturity (everyone has clear role)
- Department structure clear
- Series B readiness

### 5.2 Scaling Challenges

**Challenge 1: Founder bottleneck**

**Problem**: Founder is in all decisions; can't delegate

**Solution**:
- Hire strong leaders (trust them)
- Document decision frameworks (how to decide, not what to decide)
- CEO monthly standup (see big picture, trust teams)

**Challenge 2: Culture dilution**

**Problem**: Hiring fast → culture breaks → wrong people → morale

**Solution**:
- Hire slowly in culture-critical roles (operations, partnerships)
- Hire fast in commoditized roles (engineers, analysts)
- Culture fit interviews (each candidate meets 3+ people)

**Challenge 3: Founder burnout**

**Problem**: Working 80-hour weeks → health suffers → decisions decline

**Solution**:
- CEO takes vacation (team covers)
- Hire COO to share load
- Set example (work-life balance important)

---

## 6. Diversity & Inclusion

### 6.1 Why Diversity Matters

**Business case**:
- More diverse teams = better decisions
- Represent artist community (diverse artists)
- Attract diverse talent (larger pool)

**NGN commitment**:
- No hiring discrimination (based on protected class)
- Diverse interview panels (reduce bias)
- Equal pay for equal work (annual audit)

### 6.2 Targets (By 2027)

- Women in engineering: 30%+ (current tech is 20%)
- Women in leadership: 40%+ (current tech is 15%)
- Underrepresented minorities: 25%+ (reflect US population)

**How to achieve**:
- Source from diverse networks (HBCUs, women's coding bootcamps)
- Pay fairly (no pay gaps)
- Promote fairly (track promotion rates by demographic)

---

## 7. Compensation Philosophy & Equity

### 7.1 Equity Allocation

**How much equity for each role?**

| Role | Equity % | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Founder/CEO** | 10-15% | Standard post-Series A |
| **COO** | 1-2% | Early hire, takes risk |
| **CTO** | 1-2% | Technical leadership, important |
| **Head of Growth** | 0.5-1% | Partnership lead |
| **Head of Finance** | 0.5-1% | Finance leadership |
| **Other employees** | 0.1-0.5% | Varies by role, seniority |
| **Employee pool** | 10-15% | For future hires, incentives |
| **Investor (Series A)** | 20-25% | Typical for seed → Series A |

**Total allocation**: 50-60% to people, 30-40% to investors, 10-15% for future

### 7.2 Vesting Schedule

**Standard vesting** (retention incentive):
- 4-year vest, 1-year cliff
- Meaning: You need to stay 1 year to get ANY equity; after that, vests monthly
- After 4 years: 100% vested

**Example**:
- Employee granted: 0.5% (20,000 shares)
- After 1 year: 5,000 shares vested (25%)
- After 2 years: 10,000 shares vested (50%)
- After 3 years: 15,000 shares vested (75%)
- After 4 years: 20,000 shares vested (100%)

**Why it matters**:
- Incentivizes staying (if leave year 2, lose 75%)
- Fair (if you work hard, you eventually own it)

## 8. Leadership Development & Succession

### 8.1 Leadership Training

**By 2027, NGN invests in**:
- Executive coaching (for CEO, COO)
- Management training (for team leads)
- Product management training (for PM)

**Cost**: $50K/year
**Benefit**: Better leaders = better execution

### 8.2 Succession Planning

**For each key role**:
- Who would replace them if they left?
- What development does successor need?
- 12-month backup plan

**Example (CTO)**:
- Current: CTO
- Successor: Lead backend engineer
- Development needed: Leadership training, API architecture course
- Timeline: 12 months (train while current CTO still there)

---

## 9. Board Reporting on Talent

**Monthly CEO report to board includes**:
- Headcount (current vs plan)
- Key hires (who joined, where from)
- Departures (who left, why)
- Salary benchmarking (are we competitive?)
- Diversity metrics (are we diverse?)
- Culture score (Glassdoor, internal survey)

**Quarterly deep-dive**: Board meets with COO to review talent strategy

---

## 10. Comparison to Incumbents

| Aspect | Spotify | NGN |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **CEO background** | Business executive | Founder + visionary ✅ |
| **Team size** | 6,000+ | 40+ (smaller, more agile) ✅ |
| **Decision speed** | Slow (corporate) | Fast (startup) ✅ |
| **Artist input** | None | Artist advisor board ✅ |
| **Leadership transparency** | Investor relations | Team-wide ✅ |
| **Diversity commitment** | Yes (large corp) | Yes (intentional focus) ✅ |

**NGN's leadership is more nimble, more artist-focused.**

---

## 11. Risk Mitigation

### 11.1 Risk: Founder Becomes Bottleneck

**If CEO can't delegate**:

**Mitigation**:
- Hire COO to force delegation
- Board coaching (learn to trust)
- Performance tied to team metrics (not just personal)

**Probability**: Medium (common founder challenge)

### 11.2 Risk: Key Person Dependency

**If CTO or COO leaves**:

**Mitigation**:
- Succession planning (backup identified)
- Knowledge documentation (not in heads)
- Key person insurance (if someone critical)

**Probability**: Low (good retention practices reduce)

---

## 12. Conclusion: Professional Leadership Attracts Capital

**Series A investors want to see**:
✅ Experienced CEO (can scale company)
✅ Strong COO/operations (can manage growth)
✅ Technical credibility (can build product)
✅ Artist-centric culture (can retain users)

**NGN's leadership team satisfies all.**
