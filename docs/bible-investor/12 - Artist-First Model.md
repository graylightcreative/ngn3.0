# Chapter 12: Artist-First Model

## Executive Summary

The music industry's fundamental problem is **misaligned incentives**: Spotify maximizes engagement (listens, hours played) while minimizing artist payouts. NGN inverts this dynamic with a **90/10 philosophy**: for all direct fan support (Sparks, subscriptions, tips), NGN takes only 10% fee, giving artists 90%. This creates a virtuous cycle: better artist economics → better content → more fans → more revenue → even better economics. It's not charity; it's capitalism that works for the long tail.

---

## 1. Business Context

### 1.1 The Broken Incentive Model (Spotify)

**Spotify's model**:

```
Fan pays $12.99/month → Spotify retains 30% ($3.90) → Artist pool gets 70% ($9.09)
↓
Artists split the $9.09 based on streams
↓
Avg artist gets $0.003-0.005 per stream
↓
Artist earning $300K streams/month makes ~$900-1,500/month
```

**The incentive problem**:
- Spotify makes more money when artists get paid less (higher profit margins)
- Spotify optimizes algorithm for engagement (streams), not quality
- Independent artists are low-priority (major labels pay for promotion)
- Artists can't opt out (no alternatives exist)

**Result**: Artist economics have *declined* despite industry revenue growth. This is market failure.

### 1.2 NGN's Inverted Model

**NGN's model** (for direct artist support):

```
Fan tips $5.00 → NGN takes 10% ($0.50) → Artist gets 90% ($4.50)
↓
Artist sees immediate feedback (who tipped, how much)
↓
Artist is incentivized to create better content (direct causality)
↓
Better content → More fans → More tips → Better artist economics
↓
NGN profits from artist success (virtuous cycle)
```

**The incentive alignment**:
- NGN makes more money when artists earn more (shared upside)
- NGN optimizes for artist success (rankings, discovery, tools)
- All artists treated equally (no major label bias)
- Artists can use NGN + Spotify simultaneously (not exclusive)

**Result**: Artist economics improve proportional to talent/engagement. This is market efficiency.

### 1.3 Why 90/10 Specifically?

**Not arbitrary.** Designed to solve specific industry problems:

#### Why Not 95/5 or 99/1?

**95/5 (artist friendly)**:
- ❌ NGN can't be sustainable (5% margin too thin)
- ❌ Can't invest in product (discovery, analytics, infrastructure)
- ❌ Becomes charity, not business
- ❌ Precedent: Yelp lost to Google because it didn't monetize

**99/1 (artist friendly on surface)**:
- ❌ NGN goes out of business immediately
- ❌ Can't hire engineers, ops, partnerships
- ❌ Product stagnates
- ❌ Ultimately harms artists (no platform to distribute on)

#### Why 90/10?

**10% is the minimum** needed to:
- Pay payment processors ($0.30-0.50 per transaction)
- Cover customer support
- Maintain infrastructure
- Invest in product development
- Fund artist acquisition/partnerships
- Build sustainable business

**90% to artists is the maximum** while remaining sustainable.

**Precedent**: This mirrors successful creator economy models:
- YouTube: Creators get 55%, YouTube takes 45% (but YouTube owns distribution)
- Twitch: Streamers get 50-70% (depending on deal), Twitch takes 30-50%
- Patreon: Creators get 95%, Patreon takes 5% (but much lower volume)

**NGN's 90/10 is the "Goldilocks" ratio**: sustainable for platform + fair for creators.

## 2. Strategic Advantage: The Artist-First Flywheel

### 2.1 The Flywheel Mechanism

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  More Artists   │
                    │ Join Platform   │

                    │ & Discovery     │
                    └────────┬────────┘

                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                             ▼

                    │  Economics      │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                             └──────────────┘ (loop back)
```

**How the flywheel works**:

1. **Artists join** (2,847 today) because:
   - 90% payout > Spotify's 15%
   - Transparent earnings (see exactly what they made)
   - Radio station integration (instant discoverability)

2. **Better charts emerge** because:
   - Ranking engine uses multi-signal integrity checks (gaming-resistant)
   - Artists with real engagement surface
   - Fans discover authentic talent

3. **More fans discover** because:
   - Charts are trustworthy (unlike Spotify's algorithm)
   - Social features (tips, follow, messaging)
   - Network effects (more artists → better charts)

4. **More revenue** because:
   - Fans tip artists they discover
   - Engaged fans subscribe for premium features
   - Artists buy tickets via integrated venues

5. **Artists earn more** because:
   - Direct tips = 90% payout
   - No middlemen (no label, no distributor cut)
   - Transparent accounting

6. **Flywheel accelerates** because:
   - Better economics attract more artists
   - Larger artist base = better charts
   - Better charts = more fans
   - And the cycle repeats faster

**Critical insight**: Once the flywheel is spinning, momentum is nearly impossible to stop. This is why Spotify (spinning its flywheel for 15 years) dominates. NGN must spin its flywheel faster by 2027 to create defensible moat.

### 2.2 Competitive Moat: The 90/10 Promise

**Artists have powerful incentive to stay with NGN**:

- If Spotify matched NGN's features, would an artist switch? **Maybe.**
- If Spotify matched NGN's payout rates (90%), would they switch? **Probably not.** (Network effects favor NGN)
- If Spotify actually went 90/10, would NGN survive? **Yes.** (Already entrenched in artist network)

**This is the moat**: 90/10 payouts create artist loyalty that's hard to dislodge.

**Contrast with Spotify**:
- Spotify: Can't go 90/10 (music licensing costs = 65% of revenue)
- NGN: Can go 90/10 (we don't own music rights; we're a platform)

**Structural advantage**: Spotify's business model precludes fair artist payouts. NGN's business model enables them.

## 3. Artist Economics: Real Numbers

### 3.1 Comparison: Same Artist Across Platforms

**Meet Artist X**: Emerging independent artist with 100K monthly listeners

#### On Spotify

- Monthly listeners: 100K
- Streams: 500K (5 streams per listener)
- Payout rate: $0.004 per stream
- **Monthly earnings: $2,000**
- **Annual earnings: $24,000**

**Problem**: $24K/year is below poverty line in most developed countries. Artist must have day job or rich parents.

#### On YouTube Music

- Same 100K listeners
- Lower payout rate: $0.002 per stream
- **Monthly earnings: $1,000**
- **Annual earnings: $12,000**

**Problem**: Even worse than Spotify. Artists avoid YouTube.

#### On NGN (Combined)

- Spotify listeners: 500K streams/month @ $0.004 = $2,000/month
- **NGN Spark tips**: 100K listeners, 5% convert to tippers
  - 5K active tippers × $2/month average = $10K/month
  - **Plus Sparks: $10K/month = $120K/year**
- NGN subscriptions: 1K listeners upgrade to Spark+ @ $10/year = $10K/year
- **Total on NGN + Spotify: $24K (Spotify) + $130K (NGN) = $154K/year**

**This is a 6.4x increase in artist income.**

**But wait**: This assumes 5% conversion to Sparks. Real data from early beta:
- Artists with 100K monthly listeners getting 10-50 Sparks/day
- Some top artists getting 100+ Sparks/day
- 10-50 Sparks/day = $300-1,500/month = $3,600-18K/year just from tips

**Conservative estimate**: Artist X earns $30-50K/year from NGN tips alone (not counting subscriptions, ticketing).

**Total income on NGN + Spotify**: $50-75K/year (3-4x improvement)

### 3.2 The Economics Inflection Point

**This is the critical insight**: At a certain income level, artists can leave day job and pursue music full-time.

- $12,000/year: Below poverty line (Spotify-only)
- $24,000/year: Minimum viable (working artist, not full-time)
- $50,000/year: Full-time sustainable (artist can afford to live)
- $100,000/year: Artist is thriving

**NGN's impact**:
- Spotify alone: 99% of artists can't reach $50K/year
- NGN + Spotify: 10-20% of artists can reach $50K/year

**This is market transformation.** When artists can earn full-time income, supply of quality music increases.

## 4. Why Artists Trust the 90/10 Model

### 4.1 Transparency: Artists Know Exactly What They're Earning

**Artist Dashboard** shows:

- Spark earnings (by tip amount, fan name, date)
- Subscription revenue (total paying subscribers)
- Ticketing revenue (by event, venue, ticket quantity)
- B2B licensing (what data was licensed, to whom)
- Payouts (historical + scheduled)

**Contrast with Spotify**:
- Spotify shows: "You earned $2,147.32 this month"
- Artists have no idea: How many streams? Which songs? Which countries? Why is payout declining?
- Black box creates distrust

**NGN's transparency** creates trust. Trust creates loyalty.

### 4.2 Direct Relationship: Tips Come From Fans, Not Algorithms

**Spark tips are fundamentally different** from Spotify payouts:

- **Spotify payout**: "Platform algorithm decided 100M people listened to your song; here's your cut"
- **NGN Spark**: "5,000 fans loved your song so much they tipped you directly"

**Psychological difference**: Direct payment feels real. Algorithm payment feels abstract.

**This matters for artist behavior**: Artists optimize for fan engagement (create better music) not algorithm gaming (SEO, playlist farming).

### 4.3 Alignment: NGN Succeeds When Artists Succeed

**Artist worry**: "What if platform changes terms and cuts my payout?"

**NGN's answer**: "Our profit is tied to your success. If we cut payouts, artists leave, our revenue declines, we go out of business. It's in our financial interest to keep payouts at 90/10."

**Contrast with Spotify**: Spotify's interests are misaligned. They want higher margins (lower payouts).

**This alignment creates contractual confidence**: Artists know NGN's incentives align with theirs.

## 5. Objections & Responses

### 5.1 Objection: "Isn't 90/10 Too Generous?"

**Response**: 90/10 is the minimum viable margin for NGN to be sustainable *and* invest in product.

**Breakdown of 10% fee**:
- Payment processing: 2.5% ($0.125 on $5 Spark)
- Customer support: 1.5% (serving artists, fans)
- Infrastructure: 2% (servers, bandwidth, databases)
- Product development: 2% (engineers building discovery, analytics)
- Operations: 1.5% (compliance, legal, finance)
- **Total: 9.5%**

We round to 10% to maintain sustainability margin.

**Could we do 95/5?**
- Only if we cut product investment
- Result: Platform stagnates, artists leave anyway
- Better to be sustainable than to fail

### 5.2 Objection: "Spotify is 30%; How Can NGN Do 10%?"

**Response**: Spotify's 30% is necessary because Spotify owns music rights (licensing costs = 65% of revenue).

**Spotify's breakdown**:
- Music licensing: 65% of revenue
- Operational costs: 30%
- Profit: 5%

**NGN's breakdown** (for direct payments):
- Music licensing: 0% (we don't own rights)
- Operational costs: 10%
- Profit: 0%* (*reinvest into growth)

**Structural difference**: Spotify is a distribution business (must pay for content rights). NGN is a platform business (connects artists to fans).

### 5.3 Objection: "How Do You Make Money at 90/10?"

**Response**: NGN makes money from **multiple revenue streams**, not just Spark tips.

- Subscriptions: 85% margin
- Ticketing: 85% margin
- B2B services: 83% margin
- Spark tips: 60% margin

**Combined**: 75% gross margin across entire platform.

**This is why diversification matters**: No single revenue stream needs to be highly profitable. Collectively, platform is profitable at scale.

---

## 6. Path to Profitability With 90/10

**The math works**:

| Year | Artists | Spark Tips (NGN %) | Subscriptions | Ticketing | B2B | Total Revenue | Gross Margin | EBITDA |
|------|---------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|-----|---------------|--------------|--------|
| 2024 | 2,847 | $30K | $0 | $0 | $0 | $30K | 50% | $(1M) |
| 2025 | 5,000 | $200K | $300K | $500K | $100K | $1.1M | 70% | $(2M) |
| 2026 | 7,500 | $600K | $1.2M | $2.0M | $600K | $4.4M | 75% | $(1M) |
| 2027 | 10,000 | $1.0M | $2.5M | $3.5M | $2.4M | $8.6M | 78% | $1.5M |

**Profitable by 2027**, despite generous 90/10 artist payout.

**Why?** Because NGN is **born digital**: Low infrastructure costs, high margin subscriptions/B2B, network effects compounding.

## 7. Comparison: Artist-First vs Competitor Models

### 7.1 Spotify Model: Platform-First

**Philosophy**: Maximize platform value; minimize artist payouts

**Economics**:
- Spotify gets 30% of revenue
- Artists get 70%, split by algorithm
- Artist incentive: Get on playlists (game system)

**Outcome**:
- Spotify: Profitable, growing
- Artists: Struggling, frustrated
- Fans: Get good recommendations

**Winner**: Spotify (and major labels)

### 7.2 Bandcamp Model: Marketplace

**Philosophy**: Take small cut; let creators keep more

**Economics**:
- Artists get 80-85% of direct sales
- Bandcamp gets 15-20%
- Artist incentive: Quality product (direct sales require real fans)

**Outcome**:
- Bandcamp: Niche, growing slowly
- Artists: Fair economics, limited audience
- Fans: Boutique discovery

**Winner**: Artists (but limited scale)

### 7.3 NGN Model: Alignment

**Philosophy**: Platform succeeds when artists succeed

**Economics**:
- Artists get 90% of direct support (tips, subscriptions)
- NGN gets 10% of direct + diversified revenue (B2B, ticketing)
- Artist incentive: Create great content (direct tips + discovery)

**Outcome**:
- NGN: Sustainable profitability, rapid growth
- Artists: Fair economics, large audience
- Fans: Quality discovery + direct support

**Winner**: Artists, fans, and NGN (aligned incentives)

---

## 8. Long-Term Vision: Artist Independence

**NGN's ultimate goal**: Enable artists to be independent forever.

**Stage 1 (Today)**: Artists use NGN + Spotify (dual platform)
- NGN provides discovery + tips
- Spotify provides massive audience
- Artist earns from both

**Stage 2 (2027)**: Artists reduce Spotify dependence
- More tips flowing through NGN
- Better artist economics on NGN
- Some artists drop Spotify entirely

**Stage 3 (2030+)**: NGN is primary platform
- Distribution through APIs (connects to all DSPs)
- Artist owns relationship with fans (direct tips)
- Artist owns data (analytics, demographics)
- Artist owns rights (NGN just facilitates)

**This is the vision**: Artists become businesses owners, not product suppliers.

---

## 9. Risks to 90/10 Model

### 9.1 Risk: What If Artists Still Don't Adopt?

**Despite 90/10 payouts and transparency, what if artists don't believe NGN will survive?**

**Mitigation**:
- Series A funding (proves institutional backing)
- Profitability path clear (reduces failure risk)
- Early traction (2,847 artists already onboarded)
- Radio partnerships (validates third-party adoption)

**Probability**: Low. Beta data shows 85%+ of onboarded artists are active.

### 9.2 Risk: What If Spotify Matches 90/10?

**If Spotify launched 90/10 payouts, would NGN survive?**

**Answer**: Yes, because:
1. Spotify can't actually do 90/10 (music licensing costs prevent it)
2. Even if they could, NGN has first-mover moat in artist network
3. By 2027, NGN's 10K artist base + radio partnerships are sticky

**Probability**: Very low. Structural barriers prevent Spotify from matching.

### 9.3 Risk: What If Platform Can't Support 90/10?

**What if at massive scale (100K artists), NGN can't sustain 90/10?**

**Mitigation**:
- Unit economics validated at current scale
- Multiple revenue streams reduce dependence on tips
- Ticketing + B2B can grow faster than Sparks
- 90/10 is core brand promise; changing it would be existential mistake

**Probability**: Low. Math works to 100K+ artists.

---

## 10. Conclusion: 90/10 Is Not Charity, It's Strategy

**The artist-first model is not a feel-good mission. It's superior economics.**

- Aligns incentives (platform succeeds when artists succeed)
- Creates trust (transparency + fair payouts)
- Builds moat (artists sticky once earning real money)
- Enables flywheel (more artists → better product → more fans)
- Drives profitability (network effects + diversified revenue)

**Investor thesis**: 90/10 is why NGN wins, not why NGN is charitable.
