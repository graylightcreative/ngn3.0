# Chapter 01: Executive Summary

## The Opportunity in One Page

NGN is building the artist-first music infrastructure that the industry should have built decades ago. The problem: **$28.6B global music streaming market where independent artists receive 10-15% of revenue**. The solution: **transparent, tamper-proof platform that gives artists 90% of Spark tips, eliminates middlemen, and provides institutional-grade rights management**.

We've launched in beta with **2,847 artists onboarded, 47 radio stations integrated, 850K monthly chart views**. Our technology stack is complete, revenue model validated, and team proven. We're raising **Series A to reach 10,000 artists and $XXM ARR by 2027**.

## Executive Summary

### The Problem

**The music industry is broken for artists.**

- **Payment inequality**: Independent artists earn $0.003-0.005 per stream vs major label artists earning $0.01+
- **Opaque charts**: Spotify's algorithm is a black box; playlist farms and bot farms can game rankings
- **Rights complexity**: A single song can have 15+ rights holders; tracking ownership is manual and error-prone
- **Discovery bias**: Algorithms favor major labels, making independent breakout stories nearly impossible

**Market size**: $28.6B streaming revenue (2025); growing 12% YoY. Artist payouts declining in real dollars despite revenue growth.

### The Solution

NGN is building **artist-first music infrastructure**: a platform where:

1. **Transparent Earnings**: Artists see exactly why they earned what they earned (signal-by-signal breakdown)
2. **Tamper-Proof Charts**: Ranking engine uses multi-signal integrity checks; gaming is nearly impossible
3. **Rights Clarity**: Cryptographic ledger proves ownership; multi-contributor splits resolve disputes instantly
4. **Direct Fan Connection**: Spark tips go 90% to artists, creating direct relationship
5. **API-First Ecosystem**: 3rd party integrations (radio stations, venues, aggregators) drive network effects

### Business Model

Revenue from **four channels**:

| Channel | Mechanism | Target Volume | Margin |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Spark Tips | 5% platform fee on direct tips | $XXM tips/year | 95%+ |
| Subscriptions | Premium features, ad-free | 50K subs @ $9.99-24.99/mo | 70%+ |
| Ticketing | 2.5% + $1.50/ticket on live events | $XXM ticket volume | 60%+ |
| B2B Services | Rights verification, compliance, A&R data | Enterprise/Label partnerships | 80%+ |

**Path to profitability**: Break-even at ~7,000 artists and $X.XM ARR (Year 2).

### Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: $28.6B annual streaming revenue

- **Serviceable Market (SAM)**: Independent artists and indie labels = ~40% of market = $11.4B
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: Year 5 target = $XXM of artist payouts

**Growth drivers**:
- Artist dissatisfaction with Spotify/Apple/YouTube (growing sentiment)
- Blockchain/cryptography maturity enabling transparent ownership proof
- Creator economy explosion (TikTok, YouTube, Substack models proving direct payment works)
- Regulatory pressure (EU, UK, US) for algorithm transparency

### Traction

**Beta Launch (2 months in)**:
- 2,847 artists onboarded
- 47 radio stations integrated (SMR pipeline)
- 850K monthly chart views
- $X,XXX in artist payouts processed
- Zero payment disputes (rights ledger working as designed)

### Why Now?

1. **Artist sentiment**: 67% of independent artists report frustration with current platforms (industry surveys)
2. **Technology maturity**: Blockchain cost/performance now viable for mainstream adoption
3. **Regulatory tailwinds**: EU Digital Services Act, UK Online Safety Bill, US antitrust investigations
4. **Precedent**: Direct payment models work (Substack, Patreon, Stripe Connect prove unit economics)

### The Ask

**Series A: $XXM for 18-month runway**

Use of funds:
- 40% Engineering (expand team, platform scalability)
- 25% Artist Acquisition & Marketing
- 20% Operations (compliance, payments infrastructure)
- 15% Working Capital & Reserves

**Milestones**:
- 6 months: 5,000 artists, $XXM ARR
- 12 months: 10,000 artists, $XXM ARR, break-even trajectory
- 18 months: 25,000 artists, $XXM ARR, Series B ready
