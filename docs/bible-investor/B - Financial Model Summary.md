### Key Assumptions

**Revenue drivers**:

- Subscriptions: 2-3% conversion rate on user base
- Ticketing: $XXM ticket volume × 2.5% + $1.50 fee
- B2B: 50+ enterprise partners × $XXK average fee

**Cost drivers**:
- Payment processing: 3% of transaction volume
- Infrastructure: $XXK/month (scaling with load)
- Salaries: Growing from 9 → 40+ employees ($X.XM by 2027)
- Marketing: 5-10% of revenue (but declining % as growth becomes organic)

### Cash Position

| Year | Beginning Cash | Revenue | OpEx | Capex | **Ending Cash** | Runway (months) |
|------|----------------|---------|------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2024 | $100K | $30K | -$600K | $50K | **-$520K** | — |
| 2025 (Series A) | $5M | $600K | -$1.5M | $100K | **$4.0M** | 27 months |
| 2026 | $4.0M | $4.2M | -$2.6M | $100K | **$5.5M** | 43 months |
| 2027 | $5.5M | $10.4M | -$4.0M | $150K | **$11.8M** | — (profitable) |
| 2028 | $11.8M | $21M | -$7.0M | $200K | **$25.6M** | — (profitable) |
| 2029 | $25.6M | $35M | -$10M | $300K | **$50.3M** | — (profitable) |

### Series A Plan

**Fundraising**: $5M Series A (2025 Q1)

**Use of funds**:
- Engineering (40%): $2.0M (team of 10)
- Sales/Partnerships (25%): $1.25M (radio, aggregators)
- Operations (20%): $1.0M (finance, legal, HR)
- Marketing (15%): $0.75M (content, events, podcasts)

**Dilution**: Assuming 20% stake to Series A
- Pre-money valuation: $25M
- Post-money: $30M
- Founder retains: 80% → 64% (diluted by Series A)

### Valuation Path

| Event | Year | Valuation | Method |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| **Seed** | 2023 | $5M | Angel round |
| **Series A** | 2025 | $30M | $5M @ 20% |
| **Series B** | 2027 | $150M | 7.5x Series A (based on revenue growth) |
| **Series C** | 2029 | $500M+ | 3-4x Series B |
| **Exit** | 2030-2032 | $2-5B | 10x Series C (based on Yelp/Substack analogs) |

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Best case** (everything goes right):
- Revenue: $50M+ by 2029
- Profitability: 2025 Q4 (earlier than plan)
- Valuation: $1B+ by 2030

**Base case** (projected above):
- Revenue: $35M by 2029
- Profitability: 2026 Q2
- Valuation: $500M+ by 2030

**Downside case** (slower adoption):
- Revenue: $15M by 2029
- Profitability: 2027 Q2 (delayed)
- Valuation: $200M+ by 2030 (still valuable)

### Return to Investors

**$5M Series A at $30M post-money valuation**:

**If exit at $500M** (base case):
- Investor stake: 20%
- Return: $100M
- Multiple: 20x
- IRR: ~80% (assuming 5-year exit)

**If exit at $1B** (bull case):
- Investor stake: 20%
- Return: $200M
- Multiple: 40x
- IRR: ~120% (assuming 5-year exit)

**If exit at $250M** (bear case):
- Investor stake: 20%
- Return: $50M

- IRR: ~60% (assuming 5-year exit)

### Monthly Burn Rate

|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| 2025 | $125K | 40 months |
| 2026 | $217K | 23 months (reaching profitability) |
| 2027 | $(0) | Break-even |

### For Investors: Key Metrics to Monitor

**Monthly Board Update Should Include**:
- Revenue trend vs plan
- Artist acquisition vs plan
- Cash burn vs plan
- Unit economics (LTV/CAC, retention)
- Key risks/opportunities

**Red flags** (if any of these happen, reevaluate):
- Revenue declines 2+ months
- Artist churn > 2%/month
- Cash runway < 12 months
- LTV/CAC < 10x (unit economics break)
