## 🚨 When Things Go Wrong

### Blocker: "Gas prices too high"
1. Check: `progress-beta-2.0.3.json`
2. Reference: `203-Complete-Plan.md` → Risk Mitigation → Blockchain Volatility
3. Action: Implement gas price cap, defer non-critical anchoring
4. Notify: Tech Lead + Team Lead

### Blocker: "NFT minting failing"
1. Check: IPFS connectivity, gas reserves
2. Escalate: Full-Stack Engineer to Backend Lead
3. Activate: Fallback queue system (documented in phase)
4. Notify: Team

### Blocker: "Load test failing"
1. Profile: Database queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
2. Reference: `203-Complete-Plan.md` → Phase 6 → Testing
3. Implement: Caching, query optimization
4. Re-test: Confirm fix
